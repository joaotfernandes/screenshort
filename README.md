Android Studio plugin that provides a keyboard shortcut and an action to quickly take screenshots of connected Android devices

## Usage
Taking a screenshot is as easy as using the shortcut <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> if you're using a Mac OS keymap or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> for other keymaps.

Alternatively you can use the Find Action menu (<kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> on Mac) and search for `Take screenshot`

## Viewing screenshots
Screenshots will be saved in the root directory of the Android project that was active when the screenshot was taken and it can be either opened clicking on `Open screenshot` or revealed in the file explorer clicking on `Reveal screenshot` using the notification that is shown once the screenshot is taken
